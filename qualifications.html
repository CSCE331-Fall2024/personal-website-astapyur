    <h1>Professional Interests</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Cybersecurity: With the recent boom in AI development, attacks are becoming more efficient and effective. They can impersonate people much better than many actual people, making phishing more dangerous.</li>
        <li>AI/Machine Learning: Also because of the recent boom, it seems AI has developed in the past few years faster than many could have imagined. I just find it truly amazing how easily it can generate convincing images, videos, and texts, and that is something I would like to work on.</li>
        <li>Game development: This is more of a fleeting interest. I used to play video games a lot more in the past but as I finished my first few CS courses in college and worked on projects with teams, I appreciated the work that was put into the games I used to love to play.</li>
        <li>Theory of Computation: I would rather work in the previous fields more but this is just something that I picked up after taking Discrete Structures in Computing. I was just fascinated and had a lot of fun learning about theory in computer science.</li>
