      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Yuriy Astapov and I am a student at Texas A&M University currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science and a Minor in Mathematics.
      I am passionate about software development and all types of problem solving. Along with the skills I've developed in the classroom regarding C++, Java, Python, Linux, data structures,
      and algorithms, I am currently working with a team on a mobile app for splitting roommates' finances. This project has allowed me to branch out and
      learn React Native, Node.js, Firebase, Jira, and GitHub. More informally, working with others has taught me how to communicate and collaborate effectively
      as well as how to balance responsibility.</p>
      <p>My main concern for my future is working in something that I am interested in. Right now, I am open and
        happy to work on a variety of different projects to expand my repertoire and find my passion. I am currently interested in cybersecurity, theory of computation,
        as well as artificial intelligence and game development to some degree. My interest in computation theory budded after my first discrete structures course where
        I first learned about formal languages, logic, and set theory, while my interest in cybersecurity was spurred by just finding it plain cool.
      </p>
      <p>Outside of school and computer science, I enjoy reading, lifting, and a variety of sports, but mostly judo and taekwondo. I have a 4th 
        degree black belt in WTF taekwondo, a task that took around 12 years of training to complete. I competed for around 9 years but have recently
        taken a more casual approach. At the same time, I volunteered at my local taekwondo school in New York for more than 3 years and worked at my school in Texas for around 1 year.
        A balance of physical activity with academic work has helped me work harder by keeping me healthy. 
      </p>
      <p>I look forward to working on fascinating and potentially life-changing projects in the future.</p>
